I'm a Boya Postdoc of the School of Computer Science at Peking University supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=K1LjZxcAAAAJ">Boxin Shi</a>. I received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science, Peking University, China, in 2023. My research interests include areas of computational photography, neuromorphic camera imaging, and computer vision.
